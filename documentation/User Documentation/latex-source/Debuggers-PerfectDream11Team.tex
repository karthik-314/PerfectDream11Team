\section{Introduction}

\justifying
Cricket is a game played and loved by many in the Indian Subcontinent. It has become so popular that it does not only dominate sports, but also as a fantasy sport in the form of applications.\par
One of these applications is Dream11. Played by many in India, this app allows cricket fans to create their own cricket team in a match using players from both sides. This project allows users to get a prediction of a good Dream11 team, by observing the past individual scores of each player. These individual scores will depend on various factors under which the match was held like date, venue, opponent team players of the match.\par
This user manual provides is a comprehensive guide to the user on how to use the website \textit{Perfect Dream 11}. It includes the functionalities that the user can experience, and detailed guidance on how to use these functionalities. The project has various use cases which are described in later sections, like, \textit{Sign Up} use case, \textit{Login} use case, \texit{prediction} use case.\par
The first section provides a brief introduction to all the functionalities/use cases in the web application. It will also explain all the web pages that are included as part of the application.\par
The second section will give the user a detailed view of what each functionality is and how to use it. These details will not include the internal workings of the web application, but will be enough for the user to use every use case of the application.\par

\section{Motivation}
The primary problem that is faced by the management of any cricket team is the selection of good cricket players for any match. The selection of every player, right upto the selection of the extras decides the outcome of the game. Moreover since the feelings of many cricket fans is attached with how the game goes, it is very important for the management team to be precise.\par
With so many stake holders, and so many factors deciding the selection of a good cricket team, it is vital that the process for the selection not be manual, but rather automated in some sense. Also since there is no deterministic way of determining a perfect team, there should also be some softness associated with this automation.\par
Using the above arguments it is imperative for us to use a machine learning approach in order to predict such a team. This project applies these approaches to the fantasy sport of Dream11.\par
The objective of this project is to make the decision taking task of selecting a good team easier. Dream11 is used as a site to test these automation techniques, making it attractive for the common cricket fan to use it.\par
