Project Name:
	Perfect Dream11 Team

Motivation:
	Determining a good set of players that will play well in a match depend on various factors, like the opponent team, teammates, venue, and date. The cricket management needs to spend a lot of time and resources in order to determine a good set of players who will get a good score in the match. This problem is also faced by cricket fans on Dream11. They need to determine which set of players will play the best in the match out of the playing 30. So there is a need to automate this process using machine learning techniques based on data from previous matches.
